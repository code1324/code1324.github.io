    <p><strong>You can go to the original websites by clicking the DAWs on the table above.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="audacity" class="daw">Audacity</h2>

    <img src="https://www.audacityteam.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01-Audacity-Rhythm-Track-and-mono-vocal-track-waveform-view.png" alt="audacity" width="500">

    <p>Audacity is a great free piece of recording/editing software that can work as a DAW.</p>

    <p>It allows you to do almost anything that a regular DAW would.</p>

    <p>It’s an open source program that is compatible with Windows, OS X and Linux operating systems, which will ensure access to everyone.</p>

    <p>It comes with quite the number of included effects which are useful for getting the sound you desire, from setting the levels right to changing the sound of your voice even.</p>

    <p>Want to sound like a robot? Audacity has got you covered.</p>

    <h2 id="waveform" class="daw">Tracktion Waveform Free</h2>

    <img src="https://dt7v1i9vyp3mf.cloudfront.net/styles/news_large/s3/imagelibrary/T/TW10_1-h3jpxzDk_LISNVs7h_xmNT1CVPqd.gL_.jpg" alt="waveform" width="500">
    
    <p>Waveform, formerly known as Tracktion is a completely free, fully featured and unlimited DAW, and it looks absolutely gorgeous.</p>

    <p>This means that there is no “Lite” version, there are no track limitations, no plugin limitations, or any other constraint of sorts like on Pro Tools First or Cubase LE.</p>

    <p>In order to get this one, you will need to register. After this simply select your OS and download.</p>

    <h2 id="soundbridge" class="daw">Soundbridge</h2>

    <img src="https://www.looperman.com/media/software/0000831/looperman-software-0000831-main.jpg" alt="soundbridge" width="500">

    <p>If you’re looking for a clean looking and simple DAW, then SoundBridge might be for you.</p>

    <p>It has a very simple looking interface and it comes with all the typical things a regular DAW comes.</p>

    <p>It can record Audio, Midi, you can edit the tracks, mix them, etc.</p>

    <p>Sadly, the plugins that come with it are not that many, however, it supports any VST plugin which means that you can add them if you want to.</p>

    <h2 id="lmms" class="daw">LMMS</h2>

    <img src="https://talkinmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/LMMS-DAW.jpg" alt="lmms" width="500">

    <p>LMMS isn’t your traditional DAW.</p>

    <p>LMMS doesn’t feature audio recording capabilities like rest of the DAWs on this list, but it’s one of the best designed DAWs for MIDI recording ever.</p>

    <p>It features a variety of instruments and effect plugins as well as supporting VST plugins.</p>

    <p>It comes with quite the impressive number of synthesizers and the sounds you can achieve with them are pretty awesome, from Nintendo and Gameboy type sounds to any emulation you can think of.</p>

    <p>If bit-music is your thing, give LMMS a try!</p>

    <h2 id="cakewalk" class="daw">Cakewalk by Bandlab</h2>

    <img src="https://www.magneticmag.com/.image/t_share/MTUzNzM5OTU4NTMwNjE1MDY0/cakewalk-sonar.jpg" alt="cakewalk" width="500">

    <p>Cakewalk is considered to be the best free DAW out there, the one issue is that it’s only for Windows users (Windows 7 or higher and only 64-bit), but you are getting a $600 value DAW for absolutely free.</p>

    <p>It’s basically a rebranded version of SONAR Platinum with all its professional features included.</p>

    <p>The big difference with this DAW and the other ones on this list is that it offers an unlimited amount of audio, MIDI, Instrument, Loop and Aux Tracks in every project.</p>

    <p>Basically, you are getting a premium DAW for absolutely nothing, cool huh?</p>
